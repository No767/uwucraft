# Installing (End users)

Uwucraft is a **Fabric** mod, not a Forge mod. Only Fabric 1.17.1 is supported as of now, but later down the road I do plan on making a 1.18.x version. Feel free to port this mod to Forge if you wish to do so. Note that you will also need Fabric API installed. To install it, simply drag and drop this into your mods folder

Stable releases are not out as of now, plus the mod hasn't really gotten started yet. So if you wish to install it, create a GitHub account (or login to your GitHub account if you already have one), find the actions tab, and download the artifacts from the latest commit.

# Installing (Developers)

Uwucraft has been made with JDK 17, and IntelliJ. The current setup is made for IntelliJ as of now. Note that you will need JDK 17, Git, Gradle 7.3, and an internet connection. Clone this repo, and in order to compile it, run `gradlew build` (for Windows) or if you are on Linux, run `./gradlew build`. The compiled files will be located in `build/libs`.
